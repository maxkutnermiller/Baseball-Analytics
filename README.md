This project explores play-by-play Major League Baseball data to uncover patterns in scoring, outs, and situational outcomes. Using a dimensional model built in Snowflake, I created analytical views to examine questions such as when double and triple plays occur, how pitchers generate different types of outs, how ballparks influence batted-ball profiles, and how performance changes by game situation (e.g., bases empty vs. bases loaded).

The analysis is presented through interactive Tableau dashboards and story points, emphasizing clear comparisons, distributions, and edge cases rather than surface-level aggregates. Together, the visuals highlight how context — inning, lineup spot, ballpark, and handedness — shapes outcomes across thousands of plays.
